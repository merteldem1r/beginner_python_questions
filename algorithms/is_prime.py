Check If Prime Number

    Description: Given an integer n, determine if it is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

    Input: An integer n.

    Output: A boolean True if n is prime, False otherwise.

    Examples:

        Input: 5
        Output: True

        Input: 10
        Output: False

    Complexity:

        Time: O(sqrt(n))
        Space: O(1)

    Note: Think about how to reduce the total number of iterations and unnecessary calculations.
